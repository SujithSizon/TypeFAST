Now, if Theophilus Thadeus Thistledown, 
The succesful thistle-sifter, 
Thrust three thousand thistles through the thick of his thumb, 
See that thou, while sifting a sieve-full of unsifted thistles, 
Thrust not three thousand thistles through the thick of thy thumb.
Theophilus Thadeus Thistledown, 
The succesful thistle-sifter, 
While sifting a sieve-full of unsifted thistles, 
Thrust three thousand thistles through the thick of his thumb.
